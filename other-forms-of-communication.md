# Official Hand-signed Saja Lili

Official Hand-signed Saja Lili (OHSL) is a hand-signed system for Saja Lili that features easy and recognizable gestures for each sound.

- *a* is signed with a stretched palm
- *i*/*j* is signed with a semi-open hand
- *u*/*w* is signed with a fist
- *p* is signed with a hand with an all fingers open except the thumb
- *t* is signed with a hand with an open index, middle finger and ring finger
- *k* is signed with a fist with an open index and middle finger
- *m* is signed with a fist with an open index
- *n* is signed with a fist with an open thumb
- *s* is signed with an OK hand
- *l* is signed with a fist with an open thumb and index

If you want to be more efficient (and have two hands), you can use the right hand to sign consonants, and the left to sign vowels.

# Kimi Liki

Kimi Liki is an artistic left-to-right writing system for Saja Lili, partly inspired by [robdog's writing system for his conlang Aaltok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKsVwo62mM). Glyphs are drawn as little shapes with faces, called *lillies*. Lillies are arranged into groups that can be structured in one of these ways:

- vowel
- vowel–*n*
- consonant–vowel
- consonant–vowel–*n*

The first lillie in a word has legs.

The initial sound of the group determines the shape of the lillie:

- *a* — dotted square
- *i*/*j* — dotted triangle
- *u*/*w* — dotted circle
- *p* — hill
- *t* — square
- *k* — triangle
- *m* — circle
- *n* — cloud
- *s* — bowl
- *l* — drop

If the group has a consonant, the vowel determines the shape of the lillie's mouth:

- *a* — grin
- *i* — smile
- *u* — circle

If the group doesn't have a consonant, the lillie should have no mouth.

The way a group is expressed, determines the shape of the lillie's eyes:

- normal — dot eyes
- high tone (for emphasis or yes/no questions) — happy closed eyes

If the group ends in *n*, the lillie should have a hook-shaped hair on its head (floating in the case of *s*).

If the group starts with a vowel, that vowel is represented with a (speech) bubble with eyes on the left of the lillie, with the vowel determining its mouth shape.

If a lillie is part of a lilized word, it should have eyeglasses.

> **Note** Bubbles are not required to have eyeglasses if they're part of a lilization.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come after an opening quote, or if it's the only word in a quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the right. And if the word is supposed to come before a closing quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the left.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come before a comma, the lillie should have a lowered arm to the right of the viewer.

The first lillie in a sentence should have a raised arm to the left of the viewer, and the last one should have a raised arm to the right of the viewer.

The last lillie in an interrogative or exclamative sentence should have wiggle lines next to its hand.

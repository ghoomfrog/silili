Lil Si has 7 consonants—p, t, k, m, n,[^n] s and l—and 3 vowels—i, u and a. Its main writing system is the Latin alphabet.

[^n]: n sounds like /ŋ/ before k, as in ank (/aŋk/). /ŋ/ is the *ng* in *thing*.

*i* and *u* can alternatively be written as *j* and *w* respectively for better readability (e.g. at the start or end of a word).

All official words are monosyllabic.

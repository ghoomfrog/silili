# Tense and Aspect

Lil Si has no grammatical way to indicate tense nor aspect, and relies on other means to do so. Of course, depending on context, indicating tense may not even be necessary.

Here are some examples of sentences using temporal words to indicate tense and aspect:

<dl>
	<dt>mi lup a ank su.
	<dd>I'm going to shower (<i>lit.</i> my wanted is clean self)
	<dt>las a mul in ski taj.
	<dd>They died yesterday. (<i>lit.</i> they are dead in past day)
	<dt>ta aj tip in al taj.
	<dd>You always forget. (<i>lit.</i> you cause forgotten in all days)
	<dt>mimi a as kam tim ti.
	<dd>Mimi has been waiting all night. (<i>lit.</i> mimi is waiting since dark time)
</dl>

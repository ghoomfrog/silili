Lil Si is built with no verbs and relies on the particles *a* and *aj* to simulate them. *a* is a copula (like English *be*), and *aj* is the causative version of *a*.

Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>mi aj ki.
	<dd>I'm funny. (<i>lit.</i> I cause haha)
	<dt>mi aj pant kiw!
	<dd>I found the bird! (<i>lit.</i> I cause found bird)
</dl>

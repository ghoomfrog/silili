# Imperative

Imperative sentences (requests and commands) are unambiguously formed when *a* or *aj* are preceeded by nothing.

Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>a spi!
	<dd>Show yourself! (<i>lit.</i> be seen!)
	<dt>aj jat mi!
	<dd>Fight me! (<i>lit.</i> cause fought me!)
</dl>

Of course, depending on context, *a* or *aj* may not even be necessary.

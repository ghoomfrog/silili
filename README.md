# Lil Si

Lil Si is a minimalist constructed language with very few sounds and words, inspired by Toki Pona. It's goal is to be more usable, and have a more efficient vocabulary and grammar than Toki Pona.

> **Warning** The language is not set in stone. Official words may be added or removed, and their hand gestures may be changed at any time! Your feedback will be much appreciated! You can contact me on Discord (ghoom#1775) or Reddit ([u/Unlimiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlimiter)).

# Phonology and Orthography

**Consonants:** p t k m n s l

**Vowels:** a i u

*i* and *u* can alternatively be written as *j* and *w* respectively for better readability.

More sound rules are explained [later](#sound-rules).

# Min Si

Min Si is a hand-signed system for Lil Si. It features easy and recognizable gestures for each sound.

- *a* is signed with a stretched palm
- *i* is signed with a semi-closed hand
- *u* is signed with a fist
- *p* is signed with a hand with an all fingers open except the thumb
- *t* is signed with a hand with an open index, middle finger and ring finger
- *k* is signed with a fist with an open index and middle finger
- *m* is signed with a fist with an open index
- *n* is signed with a fist with an open thumb
- *s* is signed with an OK hand
- *l* is signed with a fist with an open thumb and index

If you want to be more efficient (and have two hands), you can use the right hand to sign consonants, and the other to sign vowels at the same time.

# Grammar

## Adjectives

Adjectives in Lil Si come before the word or phrase they modify. Nouns and adjectives are always interchangeable.

## Singular and Plural

Singular and plural nouns are not grammatically marked. For example, *kiw* can either mean one or more birds, depending on context. Use *un* (*one*) for singular, and *tutu* (*multiple*) for plural.

## Describing States and Actions

Lil Si has only two true verbs: *a* and *aj*. *a* is like English *be*, and *aj* is the causative version of it. Combining these with adjectives is how you can simulate more (fake) verbs.

- *A a B* means that *A* is *B*.
- *A aj B* means that *A* causes *B* to be the case.

*a* only matches identity and state, but not time like English *be* (where you can say *The surprise is tomorrow*). *aj* follows this pattern too but in a causative sense.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>la a swim.
	<dd>They are asleep.
	<dt>mi aj mul pukuku!
	<dd>I slayed the monster! (<i>lit.</i> I cause dead monster)
</dl>
<br>

As you can see, the fact that adjectives come before what they modify, allows verbs to come right after the subject. So the word order is SVO (subject–verb–object).

*a* and *aj* can also be nested:

<dl>
	<dt>mi kaw a sakaka aj mi a sakaka.
	<dd>My pet not being OK makes me not OK too. (<i>lit.</i> my mammal is not-OK causes I am not-OK)
</dl>
<br>

The last English sentence can also be interpreted as *If my pet is not OK, i wouldn't be OK*. So *aj* can be used as a conditional marker if used with sentences.

## Imperative

Imperative sentences (requests and commands) are unambiguously formed when *a* or *aj* are preceeded by nothing.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>a siw!
	<dd>Show yourself! (<i>lit.</i> be seen)
	<dt>aj wata mi!
	<dd>Fight me! (<i>lit.</i> cause fought me)
</dl>
<br>

Of course, depending on the context, *a* or *aj* may not even be necessary.

Make an imperative a [yes/no question](#yesno-questions) to make it explicitly polite.

## Hi and Hey

On their own, *a* can mean *hi*, and *aj* can mean *hey* (for getting attention).

Here's an example of a greeting with an addressee (the name of the greeted person):

<dl>
	<dt>a, sajmsi!
	<dd>Hi, James!
</dl>
<br>

## Conjunctions

<dl>
	<dt>i<dd>and
</dl>
<br>

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>mi sim a mam i wan.
	<dd>My sibling is big and crazy.
	<dt>in piki taj, mi aj kwan i la a pu.
	<dd>Yesterday, I sang and they danced. (<i>lit.</i> in past day, I caused sung and they were moving)
	<dt>ta wil a un u sa i sa?
	<dd>You want this or that? (<i>lit.</i> your wanted is one of that and that)
</dl>
<br>

As you can see, even tho there is no word for *or*, you can still express it.

## Yes/No Questions

Yes/no questions don't have special grammar. Just use intonation or a question mark.

**Example:**

<dl>
	<dt>ta ku a iti?
	<dd>You have food? (<i>lit.</i> your possession is food)
</dl>
<br>

## Fact Questions

*ka* (*what*) is the only question pronoun (like *how* and *why*).

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>ka a mi? ka a ta?
	<dd>What am I? What are you?
	<dt>in ka ti a mun in sun?
	<dd>When is the eclipse? (<i>lit.</i> in what time is moon on star)
	<dt>ka man aj iti mi japa wa?!
	<dd>Who drank my juice?! (<i>lit.</i> what human causes consumed my fruit liquid)
	<dt>kam ka a ta tinki?
	<dd>Why do you think so? (<i>lit.</i> from what is your thought)
	<dt>ka nan a ta in sja?
	<dd>How are you flying? (<i>lit.</i> what manner is you in sky)
	<dt>pi ka (tal)?
	<dd>To where? (<i>lit.</i> to what (place))
</dl>

## Preposition Flexibility

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them. They can simply be infered. All the following sentences using *in* are correct:

<dl>
	<dt>ata in a nu kan.
	<dd>The contents are unknown. (<i>lit.</i> things in are not known)
	<dt>la a in sa?
	<dd>They are in there? (<i>lit.</i> they are in that)
	<dt>a in!
	<dd>Get in! (<i>lit.</i> be in)
</dl>

## Tense and Aspect

There is no grammatical way to indicate tense or aspect.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>mi wil a wis su kum wa.
	<dd>I'm going to shower (<i>lit.</i> my wanted is clean self with water)
	<dt>la a mul in piki taj.
	<dd>It died yesterday. (<i>lit.</i> it is dead in past day)
	<dt>sa a twam pi ta in al taj.
	<dd>You always forget that. (<i>lit.</i> that is forgotten for you in all days)
	<dt>mali a as kam tum ti.
	<dd>Marry has been waiting all night. (<i>lit.</i> Marry is waiting from dark time)
</dl>

Of course, depending on context, indicating tense may not even be necessary.

# Lilization

Lilization is when you make a foreign name fit within Lil Si's limited sounds.

## Sound Rules

- Syllables can optionally start with any consonant, have any number of vowels in the middle, and optionally end in *m*, *n*, *s* or *l*.
- *np* and *mt* are disallowed inside a single word.
- The *n* in *nk* can sound like the *ng* in *thing*.

## Methods

A good rule of thumb is to go by instinct and determine what sounds the closest to the original name to you.

Lilizing names from their native languages is the most language-neutral way to do so. But since it can be tiring to memorize lots of lilizations from their native languages, my best advice is to know the most common language between you and your chat partners and lilize the name from that.

For example, if the common language is English and the country you want to talk about is Norway, just lilize that English word to get *nulwaj*.

Lastly, if you have no idea how to lilize something, just say or write it as is in a language you know. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

> **Note** Sometimes it might be necessary to capitalize names that look like native Lil Si words.

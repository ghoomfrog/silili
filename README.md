# Saja Lili

Saja Lili is a minimalist constructed language with very few sounds and words, inspired by Toki Pona. It's goal is to be more usable, and have a more efficient vocabulary and grammar than Toki Pona.

> **Warning** The language is not set in stone. Official words may be added or removed, and their hand gestures may be changed at any time! Your feedback will be much appreciated! You can contact me on Discord (ghoom#1775) or Reddit ([u/Unlimiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlimiter)).

# Phonology and Orthography

**Consonants:** p t k m n s l j w

**Vowels:** a i u

*j* is the *y* consonant in English.

More sound rules are explained [later](#sound-rules).

# Other Ways to Communicate

There's [Saja Min](#saj-min) (a hand-signed system) and [Kimi Liki](#kim-liki) (a cute writing system).

# Grammar

## Adjectives

Adjectives in Saja Lili come after the word or phrase they modify. Nouns and adjectives are always interchangeable.

## Singular and Plural

Singular and plural nouns are not grammatically marked. For example, *kiwi* can either mean one or more birds, depending on context. Use *un* (*one*) for singular, and *tutu* (*group*) for plural.

## Describing States and Actions

Saja Lili has no verbs.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>aju lipi.
	<dd>They are asleep. (<i>lit.</i> them asleep)
	<dt>ana aja pukuku mulu!
	<dd>I slayed the monster! (<i>lit.</i> me [context marker] monster dead)
</dl>
<br>

*aja* marks the agent, context or condition for the next phrase. The agent here is a word or phrase that refers to something that causes the next phrase to be true.

## Imperative

Imperative sentences (requests and commands) don't have special grammar.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>siwi!
	<dd>Show yourself! (<i>lit.</i> seen)
	<dt>aja ana atata!
	<dd>Fight me! (<i>lit.</i> [context marker] me fought)
</dl>
<br>

As you can see, *aj* can be used as an imperative marker when preceded by nothing.

Make an imperative a [yes/no question](#yesno-questions) to make it explicitly polite.

## Conjunctions

<dl>
	<dt>ija<dd>and
</dl>
<br>

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>jan ana ju mama sama ju maka i wiwi.
	<dd>My sibling is big and crazy. (<i>lit.</i> mutually-known-person mine of parent same of big and crazy)
	<dt>in jala umu pusu, kaja musi ana ija aju pipi.
	<dd>Yesterday, I sang and they danced. (<i>lit.</i> in cycle ground past, uttered fun mine and them moving)
	<dt>wili anta in un ju uju ija uju?
	<dd>You want this or that? (<i>lit.</i> wanted yours in one of near and far)
</dl>

## Yes/No Questions

Yes/no questions don't have special grammar. Just use tone or a question mark.

**Example:**

<dl>
	<dt>kun anta iti?
	<dd>You have food? (<i>lit.</i> possession yours food)
</dl>

## Fact Questions

*kuwa* (*what*) is the only question pronoun.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>ana kuwa? anta kuwa?
	<dd>What am I? What are you? (<i>lit.</i> me what? you what?)
	<dt>mun lili in mun siliki in timi kuwa?
	<dd>When is the eclipse? (<i>lit.</i> celestial-body small on celestial-body shining in time what)
	<dt>man kuwa aja wan japa ana iti?!
	<dd>Who drank my juice?! (<i>lit.</i> human what [context marker] liquid fruit mine food)
	<dt>tinki anta kama kuwa?
	<dd>Why do you think so? (<i>lit.</i> thought yours from what)
	<dt>anta in sija ju nan kuwa?
	<dd>How are you flying? (<i>lit.</i> you in sky of manner what)
	<dt>pija (tala) kuwa?
	<dd>To where? (<i>lit.</i> to (place) what)
</dl>

## Preposition Flexibility

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them. They can simply be infered. All the following sentences using *in* are correct:

<dl>
	<dt>ata in ju kan nu.
	<dd>The contents are unknown. (<i>lit.</i> things in of known not)
	<dt>in!
	<dd>Get in! (<i>lit.</i> in)
</dl>

## Tense and Aspect

There is no grammatical way to indicate tense or aspect.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>wili ana ju suwa wisi kumu wan.
	<dd>I will shower. (<i>lit.</i> wanted mine of self clean with liquid)
	<dt>aju mulu in jala umu pusu.
	<dd>It died yesterday. (<i>lit.</i> it dead in cycle ground past)
	<dt>anta aja uju tipi in ala timi.
	<dd>You always forget that. (<i>lit.</i> that forgotten for you in whole time)
	<dt>Mali asu kama timi tumu.
	<dd>Marry has been waiting all night. (<i>lit.</i> Marry waiting from time dark)
</dl>

Of course, if the context is clear, indicating tense or aspect is not necessary.

# Lilization

Lilization is when you make a foreign name fit within Saja Lili's limited sounds.

## Sound Rules

- Syllables can optionally start with any consonant, have a vowel in the middle, and optionally end in *n*.
- *ji* and *wu* are not allowed.
- The *n* in *np* or *nm* can sound like *m*.
- The *n* in *nk* can sound like the *ng* in *thing*.

## Methods

A good rule of thumb is to go by instinct and determine what sounds the closest to the original name to you.

Lilizing names from their native languages is the most language-neutral way to do so. But since it can be tiring to memorize lots of lilizations from their native languages, my best advice is to know the most common language between you and your chat partners and lilize the name from that.

For example, if the common language is English and the country you want to talk about is Norway, just lilize that English word to get something like *Nuwai*.

Lastly, if you have no idea how to lilize something, just say or write it as is in a language you know. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

> **Note** It's not required to capitalize lilizations, but sometimes it might be necessary to capitalize names that look like native Saja Lili words.

	<dd>thank you (<i>lit.</i> (you) liked)
	<dt>piliki nu
	<dd>you're welcome (<i>lit.</i> difficult not)
	<dt>wili ana nu
	<dd>sorry (<i>lit.</i> wanted mine not)
	<dt>wili
	<dd>please (<i>lit.</i> wanted)
	<dt>nija jasa
	<dd>welcome (<i>lit.</i> near liked)
	<dt>aja awa jama
	<dd>goodbye (<i>lit.</i> [context marker] far okay)
	<dt>anti aja ...
	<dd>but ... (<i>lit.</i> contrasting [context marker] ...)
	<dt>ala tutu ...
	<dd>all ... (<i>lit.</i> whole group ...)
</dl>

# Saja Min

Saja Min is a hand-signed system for Saja Lili that features easy and recognizable gestures for each sound.

- *a* is signed with a stretched palm
- *i*/*j* is signed with a semi-open hand
- *u*/*w* is signed with a fist
- *p* is signed with a hand with an all fingers open except the thumb
- *t* is signed with a hand with an open index, middle finger and ring finger
- *k* is signed with a fist with an open index and middle finger
- *m* is signed with a fist with an open index
- *n* is signed with a fist with an open thumb
- *s* is signed with an OK hand
- *l* is signed with a fist with an open thumb and index

If you want to be more efficient (and have two hands), you can use both hands to sign two sounds at the same time. The right hand should sign the preceding sound.

# Kimi Liki

Kimi Liki is an artistic left-to-right writing system for Saja Lili, partly inspired by [robdog's writing system for his conlang Aaltok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKsVwo62mM). Glyphs are drawn as little shapes with faces, called *lillies*. Lillies are arranged into groups that can be structured in one of these ways:

- vowel
- vowel–*n*
- consonant–vowel
- consonant–vowel–*n*

The first lillie in a word has legs.

The initial sound of the group determines the shape of the lillie:

- *a* — dotted square
- *i*/*j* — dotted triangle
- *u*/*w* — dotted circle
- *p* — hill
- *t* — square
- *k* — triangle
- *m* — circle
- *n* — cloud
- *s* — bowl
- *l* — drop

If the group has a consonant, the vowel determines the shape of the lillie's mouth:

- *a* — grin
- *i* — smile
- *u* — circle

If the group doesn't have a consonant, the lillie should have no mouth.

The way a group is expressed, determines the shape of the lillie's eyes:

- normal — dot eyes
- high tone (for emphasis or yes/no questions) — happy closed eyes

If the group ends in *n*, the lillie should have a hook-shaped hair on its head (floating in the case of *s*).

If the group starts with a vowel, that vowel is represented with a (speech) bubble with eyes on the left of the lillie, with the vowel determining its mouth shape.

If a lillie is part of a lilized word, it should have eyeglasses.

> **Note** Bubbles are not required to have eyeglasses if they're part of a lilization.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come after an opening quote, or if it's the only word in a quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the right. And if the word is supposed to come before a closing quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the left.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come before a comma, the lillie should have a lowered arm to the right of the viewer.

The first lillie in a sentence should have a raised arm to the left of the viewer, and the last one should have a raised arm to the right of the viewer.

The last lillie in an interrogative or exclamative sentence should have wiggle lines next to its hand.

**Example:**

*man lili Piita ija lusu aju aja saja "timi jasa"?*

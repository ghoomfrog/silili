# Silili

Silili is a small, logical, work-in-progress language, with a minimalist grammar and an efficient vocabulary.

### ABCs

Silili uses these sounds: *a i j k l m n p s t u w*. All the vowels are short, and *j* is like English *y*.

### Content Words

Content words are not split into nouns and adjectives. If a word can be a noun, it can also be an adjective in the same context. There is no "adjective order", since content words modify each other in the same way.

red bird — *lulu kiwi* — *kiwi lulu*

Content words that come beforehand, are generally more emphasized.

### Singular and Plural

Words are not singular nor plural on their own. For example, *kiwi* can mean one bird or multiple birds. You can use *un* (one) to mark singular, and double the word to mark plural.

*un kiwi* — a bird

*kiwi kiwi* — birds

### Arbitrary Relation

*ju* connects two related words or phrases, like the way "of" does.

*kiwi ju kana* — bird of knowledge

### Yes/No Questions

You can use tone or a question mark for yes/no questions.

*iti nama?* — Good food? — Is the food good?

### Or

*wa* means "or".

*ana wa anta* — me or you

You can use *kumu* (with) to mean "and".

*ana kumu anta* — me with you — me and you

### What

"What" in Silili is *kuwa*. Combine it with other words to form other question words like "when".

*kuwa anta?* — Who are you?

*kuwa timi nama?* — What time is good?

### Causative Subjects

*ja* introduces a causative subject, which refers to the thing that causes the next word or phrase to be the case.

*ana ja iti kiwi.* — I caused the food bird. — I ate the bird.

### Conditions

*wi* introduces a condition for the next word or phrase.

*iti nama wi anta nama.* — If the food is good, you're good.

### Requests and Commands

You can use *wili* (will/wanted) with *anta* for requests and commands.

*wili ju anta siwi!* — Will of you seen! — Be seen!

Or if the context is clear (for example, when the thing you want didn't happen yet), just say what you want:

*anta siwi!* — You're seen! — Be seen!

### Quantity vs Intensity

Some determiners have different meanings depending on if the modified word is plural or not. For example:

*masa nama* — very good

*masa nama nama* — many good things

### Prepositions

*kiwi in ama* — bird in/on water

*kiwi pija ama* — bird to water

*kiwi kama ama* — bird from water

*kiwi kumu ana* — bird with me

Prepositions don't require content words before or after them:

*lipi kiwi in* — sleeping bird inside

### Sound Rules

Silili has very limited rules on how words can be spoken. All syllables can optionally start with a consonant, have a vowel in the middle, and optionally end in *n*.

Vowels next to each other, *nn* and *nm* in a single word are not allowed. So are *ji* and *wu*.

### Interjections

Interjections are allowed to break the sound rules. Feel free to make up your own!

*alu!* — hey!

*kiki!* — haha!

*uu!* — oo!

You can use interjections as content words.

### Lilizations

A lilization is a foreign word spoken with the limited sound rules.

*Apika* — Africa

*Kun* — Ghoom

It's not required to capitalize lilizations. But it might be necessary if the lilization looks exactly like a native Silili word.

It's best to lilize words from their original language if possible.

### Numbers

There are only six digits in Silili aside from 0 (*nu*).

un — 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tutu — 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tuwi — 3
kata — 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pinki — 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun — 6

This system is called senary or seximal. *sun* here is the "ten" in this system.

Let's dissect the following number to understand more:

*kata sun sun un sun tutu* — 412 (in senary) — 152 (in decimal)

Multiple *sun*'s next to each other are multiplied alongside the digit that comes immediately before *sun*.

*kata sun sun* — 4×6×6

*un sun* — 1×6

The final products are then added with the last digit.

*kata sun sun un sun tutu* — 4×6×6 + 1×6 + 2

Numbers are cardinal with plurals, and ordinal with non-plurals.

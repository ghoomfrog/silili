# Lil Si

Lil Si is a minimalist constructed language with very few sounds and words, inspired by Toki Pona.

All words in this document are paired with description of their hand gestures, as part of a hand-signed version of Lil Si, called Min Si. It only requires one hand and a visible face (though the other hand can be used for more efficient number gestures).

> **Warning** The language is not set in stone, and official words may be added or removed at any time! Your feedback would be much appreciated! You can contact me on Discord (ghoom#1775) or Reddit ([u/Unlimiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlimiter)).

# Phonology and Orthography

**Consonants:** p t k m n s l

**Vowels:** i u a

*i* and *u* can alternatively be written as *j* and *w* respectively for better readability.

More sound rules are explained [later](#sound-rules).

# Grammar

## Adjectives

Adjectives in Lil Si come before the word or phrase they modify, which can be modified in different ways: for example, *mun man* can mean *human of the moon* or *human who is the moon*.

## Singular and Plural

Singular and plural nouns are not marked by default. For example, *kiw* can either mean one or more birds, depending on context. Use *un* (*one*) for singular, and *tutu* (*group*) for plural.

## Describing States and Actions

Lil Si has only two true verbs: *a* and *aj*. *a* (pronouned *aa*) is like English *be*, and *aj* is the causative version of it. Combining these with adjectives is how you can simulate more (fake) verbs.

- *A a B* means that *A* is *B*.
- *A aj B* means that *A* causes *B* to be the case.

*a* only matches identity and state, but not time like English *be* (where you can say *The surprise is tomorrow*). *aj* follows this pattern too but in a causative sense.

### Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>la a swim.
	<dd>They are asleep.
	<dt>mi aj mul pukuku!
	<dd>I slayed the monster! (<i>lit.</i> I cause dead monster)
</dl>

As you can see, the fact that adjectives come before what they modify, allows verbs to come right after the subject. So the word order is SVO (subject–verb–object).

### In Min Si:

- *a* is a vertical sideways flat hand in front of the chest.
- *aj* is a sideways fist, not near the head or chest.

## Imperative

Imperative sentences (requests and commands) are unambiguously formed when *a* or *aj* are preceeded by nothing.

### Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>a siw!
	<dd>Show yourself! (<i>lit.</i> be seen)
	<dt>aj wata mi!
	<dd>Fight me! (<i>lit.</i> cause fought me)
</dl>

Of course, depending on the context, *a* or *aj* may not even be necessary.

## Hi and Hey

On their own, *a* can mean *hi*, and *aj* can mean *hey*. The former is a greeting, and the latter is for getting attention.

Here's an example of a greeting with an addressee (the name of the greeted person):

<dl>
	<dt>a, sajmsi!
	<dd>Hi, James!
</dl>

## Conjunctions

<dl>
	<dt>i (pronounced *ii*)<dd>and
	<dt>kaj
	<dd>1. if/when
	<dd>2. context marker
</dl>

### Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>mi sim a maka i wan.
	<dd>My sibling is big and crazy.
	<dt>in piki taj, mi aj kwan i la a pu.
	<dd>Yesterday, I sang and they danced. (<i>lit.</i> in past day, I caused sung and they were moving)
	<dt>ta wil a un u saj i kawa?
	<dd>You want tea or coffee? (<i>lit.</i> your wanted is one of tea and coffee)
	<dt>mi a mul kaj ta a mul.
	<dd>If you die, I die. (<i>lit.</i> I am dead if you are dead)
	<dt>kaj lam, ta a kiw.
	<dd>*imagining* You would be a bird. (<i>lit.</i> [in the context of] imagination, you are bird)
</dl>

The last two sentences can also be flipped:

- *kaj ta a mul, mi a mul*.
- *ta a kiw kaj lam*.

### In Min Si:

- *i* is a forward semi-closed hand.
- *kaj* is a downward fist with an open thumb.

## Yes/No Questions

Yes/no questions don't have special grammar. Just use intonation or a question mark.

### Example:

<dl>
	<dt>ta ku a iti?
	<dd>You have food? (<i>lit.</i> your possession is food)
</dl>

## Fact Questions

*ka* means *what*, and it's the only question pronoun (like *how* and *why*).

### Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>ka a mi? ka a ta?
	<dd>What am I? What are you?
	<dt>in ka ti a mun in sun?
	<dd>When is the eclipse? (<i>lit.</i> in what time is moon on sun)
	<dt>ka man aj it mi japa wa?!
	<dd>Who drank my juice?! (<i>lit.</i> what human causes consumed my fruity liquid)
	<dt>ta kan a kam ka?
	<dd>Why do you think so? (<i>lit.</i> your thought is from what)
	<dt>ka nan a pas ta?
	<dd>How are you flying? (<i>lit.</i> what manner is flying you)
	<dt>pi ka tal?
	<dd>To where? (<i>lit.</i> to what place)
</dl>

### In Min Si:

- *ka* is a semi-closed downward hand turning up.

## Noun/Adjective Interchangeability

Nouns and adjectives are always interchangeable. Here are some examples:

<dl>
	<dt>Adjective to noun:
	<dd><i>lun</i> (<i>colorful</i>) → <i>lun</i> (<i>colorful thing</i>)
	<dt>Noun to adjective:
	<dd><i>kim</i> (<i>stone</i>) → <i>kim</i> (<i>stone-made</i> or <i>stone-related</i>)
</dl>

## Preposition Flexibility

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them. All the following sentences using *in* are correct:

<dl>
	<dt>ata in a nu kan.
	<dd>The contents are unknown. (<i>lit.</i> things in are not known)
	<dt>la a in sa?
	<dd>They are in there? (<i>lit.</i> they are in that)
	<dt>a in!
	<dd>Get in! (<i>lit.</i> be in)
</dl>

## Tense and Aspect

Lil Si has no grammatical way to indicate tense or aspect, and relies on other means to do so. Of course, depending on context, indicating tense may not even be necessary.

### Examples:

<dl>
	<dt>mi wil a wis su kum wa.
	<dd>I'm going to shower (<i>lit.</i> my wanted is clean self with water)
	<dt>la a mul in piki taj.
	<dd>It died yesterday. (<i>lit.</i> it is dead in past day)
	<dt>sa a tipi pi ta in al taj.
	<dd>You always forget that. (<i>lit.</i> that is forgotten for you in all days)
	<dt>mimi a as kam tum ti.
	<dd>Mimi has been waiting all night. (<i>lit.</i> Mimi is waiting from dark time)
</dl>

# Lilization

Lilization is when you make a foreign name fit within Lil Si's limited sounds.

## Sound Rules

Syllables can optionally start with any consonant, have a vowel in the middle, and optionally end in *m*, *n*, *s* or *l*.

The *n* in *nk* can sound like the *ng* in *thing*.

## Methods

A good rule of thumb is to go by instinct and determine what sounds the closest to the original name to you.

Lilizing names from their native languages is the most language-neutral way to do so. But since it can be tiring to memorize lots of lilizations from their native languages, my best advice is to know the most common language between you and your chat partners and lilize the name from that.

For example, if the common language is English and the country you want to talk about is Norway, just lilize that English word, to get *nulwaj*.

Lastly, if you have no idea how to lilize something, just say or write it as is in the language you know. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

> **Note** Sometimes it might be necessary to capitalize names that look like native Lil Si words.

## Numbers

	<dt>tu<dd>two
	<dt>twi<dd>three
	<dt>kata<dd>four
	<dt>tin<dd>five
</dl>

### Examples:

In these examples, Lil Si phrases are in base-6, and the english translations are in base-10.

<dl>
	<dt>tin twi (13)
	<dd>eight (<i>lit.</i> five + three)
	<dt>kata tin tin tu tin tu (422)
	<dd>one hundred and twelve (<i>lit.</i> four × five × five + nine × ten + seven)
	<dt>tin un (11) tu
	<dd>six pairs (<i>lit.</i> five + one twos)
	<dt>taj kata
	<dd>fourth day (<i>lit.</i> day four)
</dl>

Cardinal numerals come before the word or phrase, and ordinal numerals come after it.

### In Min Si:

- *kwa* is a wiggling cup hand.
- *un* is a forward fist with an open index.
- *tu* is a forward fist with an open index and middle finger.
- *twi* is a forward fist with an open index, middle finger and ring finger.
- *kata* is a forward open hand with a closed thumb.
- *tin* is a forward flat hand with stretched fingers.

If you want to use two hands to gesture numbers, use the left hand for units, and the right one for sixes. The maximum number you can gesture with this method is 55 in seximal (35 in decimal).

# Saja Lili

Saja Lili is a small work-in-progress language inspired by Toki Pona. It's designed to be have an easier grammar but a bigger vocabulary.

## ABCs

Saja Lili uses these sounds: *a i j k l m n p s t u w*. All the vowels are short, and *j* is like English *y*.

## Adjectives

Adjectives come after nouns. So if you wanna say "red bird", you say it like "bird red", or *kiwi lulu*.

Sometimes adjectives are not used literally. For example, *kiwi wan* literally means "bird that is water", but it could also mean "water bird", "wet bird" or "bird that belongs to the water".

## Singular and Plural

Words are not singular nor plural on their own. *kiwi* can mean one bird or multiple birds. The words *un* (one) and *tutu* (group) can be used to explicitly mark singular and plural.

*kiwi un* = a bird

*kiwi tutu* = birds

## To Be

Saja Lili has no verbs. Everything is a noun phrase. So if you wanna say that the food is good, you just say "good food", or *iti jasa*.

## Delimiting Phrases

*ju* can be used to control the order in which words are interpreted.

*iti wan kiwi* = bird drink

*iti ju wan kiwi* = food of water bird

## Yes/No Questions

Just use tone or a question mark for yes/no questions.

*iti jasa?* = Is the food good?

*sin! jasa mawa!* = Yes! Very good!

*nu. jasa nu.* = No. Not good.

## And

"And" is Saja Lili is *ija*.

*ana ija mama anta* = me and your parent

## What

"What" in Saja Lili is *kuwa*. Combine it with other words to form other question words like "when".

*anta kuwa?* = Who are you?

*iti in timi kuwa?* = What time is the food?

## Context Phrases

*aja* introduces context for the next phrase. The context can be a topic, subject, condition or whatever.

*iti aja uju jasa?* = Speaking of food, is this good?

*kiwi aja ana wan!* = The bird made me wet!

*iti jasa aja anta jasa.* = If the food is good, you're good.

## Requests and Commands

Requests and commands can only be infered from the context of the conversation.

*anta siwi!* = Be seen!

*anta aja ana atata!* = Fight me!

## Prepositions

*kiwi in wan.* = The bird is in the water.

*kiwi pija wan.* = The bird is going toward the water.

*kiwi kama wan.* = The bird is coming out of the water.

*ana lipi kumu kiwi.* = I'm sleeping with the bird.

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them.

*kiwi in ju lipi.* = The bird inside is asleep.

## Sound Rules

Saja Lili has very limited rules on how words can be spoken. All syllables can optionally start with a consonant, have a vowel in the middle, and optionally end in *n*.

## Interjections

Interjections are allowed to break the sound rules. Feel free to make up your own!

*kiki!* = haha!

*uu!* = oo!

*muwa!* = mwah!

## Lilizations

A lilization is a foreign word spoken with the limited sound rules.

*Apika* = Africa

*Kuumu* = Ghoom

It's not required to capitalize lilizations.

It's best to lilize words from their original languages if possible.

## Numbers

There are only six digits in Saja Lili (partly thanks to [jan Misali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qID2B4MK7Y0)).

nu = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; un = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tuwi = 2

taja = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kata = 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun = 5

This system is called senary or seximal.

Let's dissect the following number to understand how things work in Saja Lili:

*kata sun sun un sun tuwi* = 412 (in senary) = 107 (in decimal)

Multiple *sun*'s next to each other are multiplied alongside the digit that comes immediately before *sun*.

*kata sun sun* = 4×5×5

*un sun tuwi* = 1×5

The final products are then added with the last digit.

*kata sun sun un sun tuwi* = 4×5×5 + 1×5 + 2

# Vocabulary

# Saja Min

Saja Min is a hand-signed system for Saja Lili that features easy and recognizable gestures for each sound.

- *a* is signed with a stretched palm
- *i*/*j* is signed with a semi-open hand
- *u*/*w* is signed with a fist
- *p* is signed with a hand with an all fingers open except the thumb
- *t* is signed with a hand with an open index, middle finger and ring finger
- *k* is signed with a fist with an open index and middle finger
- *m* is signed with a fist with an open index
- *n* is signed with a fist with an open thumb
- *s* is signed with an OK hand
- *l* is signed with a fist with an open thumb and index

If you want to be more efficient (and have two hands), you can use both hands to sign two sounds at the same time. The right hand should sign the preceding sound.

# Kimi Liki

Kimi Liki is an artistic left-to-right writing system for Saja Lili, partly inspired by [robdog's writing system for his conlang Aaltok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKsVwo62mM). Glyphs are drawn as little shapes with faces, called *lillies*. Lillies are arranged into groups that can be structured in one of these ways:

- vowel
- vowel–*n*
- consonant–vowel
- consonant–vowel–*n*

The first lillie in a word has legs.

The initial sound of the group determines the shape of the lillie:

- *a* — dotted square
- *i*/*j* — dotted triangle
- *u*/*w* — dotted circle
- *p* — hill
- *t* — square
- *k* — triangle
- *m* — circle
- *n* — cloud
- *s* — bowl
- *l* — drop

If the group has a consonant, the vowel determines the shape of the lillie's mouth:

- *a* — grin
- *i* — smile
- *u* — circle

If the group doesn't have a consonant, the lillie should have no mouth.

The way a group is expressed, determines the shape of the lillie's eyes:

- normal — dot eyes
- high tone (for emphasis or yes/no questions) — happy closed eyes

If the group ends in *n*, the lillie should have a hook-shaped hair on its head (floating in the case of *s*).

If the group starts with a vowel, that vowel is represented with a (speech) bubble with eyes on the left of the lillie, with the vowel determining its mouth shape.

If a lillie is part of a lilized word, it should have eyeglasses.

> **Note** Bubbles are not required to have eyeglasses if they're part of a lilization.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come after an opening quote, or if it's the only word in a quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the right. And if the word is supposed to come before a closing quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the left.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come before a comma, the lillie should have a lowered arm to the right of the viewer.

The first lillie in a sentence should have a raised arm to the left of the viewer, and the last one should have a raised arm to the right of the viewer.

The last lillie in an interrogative or exclamative sentence should have wiggle lines next to its hand.

**Example:**

*man lili Piita ija lusu aju aja saja "timi jasa"?*

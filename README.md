# Saja Lili

Saja Lili is a small work-in-progress language inspired by Toki Pona. It's designed to be have an easier grammar but a bigger vocabulary.

## ABCs

Saja Lili uses these sounds: *a i j k l m n p s t u w*. All the vowels are short, and *j* is like English *y*.

## Adjectives

Adjectives come after nouns. So if you wanna say "red bird", you say it like "bird red", or *kiwi lulu*.

Sometimes adjectives are not used literally. For example, *kiwi wan* literally means "bird that is water", but it could also mean "water bird", "wet bird" or "bird that belongs to the water".

## Singular and Plural

Words are not singular nor plural on their own. *kiwi* can mean one bird or multiple birds. The words *un* (one) and *tutu* (group) can be used to explicitly mark singular and plural.

*kiwi un* = a bird

*kiwi tutu* = birds

## To Be

Saja Lili has no verbs. Everything is a noun phrase. So if you wanna say that the food is good, you just say "good food", or *iti jasa*.

## Delimiting Phrases

*ju* can be used to control the order in which words are interpreted.

*iti wan kiwi* = bird drink

*iti ju wan kiwi* = food of water bird

## Yes/No Questions

Just use tone or a question mark for yes/no questions.

*iti jasa?* = Is the food good?

*sin! jasa mawa!* = Yes! Very good!

*nu. jasa nu.* = No. Not good.

## And

"And" is Saja Lili is *ija*.

*ana ija mama anta* = me and your parent

## What

"What" in Saja Lili is *kuwa*. Combine it with other words to form other question words like "when".

*anta kuwa?* = Who are you?

*iti in timi kuwa?* = What time is the food?

## Context Phrases

*aja* introduces context for the next phrase. The context can be a topic, subject, condition or whatever.

*iti aja uju jasa?* = Speaking of food, is this good?

*kiwi aja ana wan!* = The bird made me wet!

*iti jasa aja anta jasa.* = If the food is good, you're good.

## Requests and Commands

Requests and commands can only be infered from the context of the conversation.

*anta siwi!* = Be seen!

*anta aja ana atata!* = Fight me!

## Prepositions

*kiwi in wan.* = The bird is in the water.

*kiwi pija wan.* = The bird is going toward the water.

*kiwi kama wan.* = The bird is coming out of the water.

*ana lipi kumu kiwi.* = I'm sleeping with the bird.

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them.

*kiwi in ju lipi.* = The bird inside is asleep.

## Sound Rules

Saja Lili has very limited rules on how words can be spoken. All syllables can optionally start with a consonant, have a vowel in the middle, and optionally end in *n*.

## Interjections

Interjections are allowed to break the sound rules. Feel free to make up your own!

*kiki!* = haha!

*uu!* = oo!

*muwa!* = mwah!

## Lilizations

A lilization is a foreign word spoken with the limited sound rules.

*Apika* = Africa

*Kuumu* = Ghoom

It's not required to capitalize lilizations.

It's best to lilize words from their original languages if possible.

## Numbers

There are only six digits in Saja Lili (partly thanks to [jan Misali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qID2B4MK7Y0)).

nu = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; un = 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tuwi = 2

taja = 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kata = 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun = 5

This system is called senary or seximal.

Let's dissect the following number to understand how things work in Saja Lili:

*kata sun sun un sun tuwi* = 412 (in senary) = 107 (in decimal)

Multiple *sun*'s next to each other are multiplied alongside the digit that comes immediately before *sun*.

*kata sun sun* = 4×5×5

*un sun tuwi* = 1×5

The final products are then added with the last digit.

*kata sun sun un sun tuwi* = 4×5×5 + 1×5 + 2

# Saja Lili

Saja Lili is a small work-in-progress language inspired by Toki Pona. It's designed to have an easier grammar but a bigger vocabulary.

### ABCs

Saja Lili uses these sounds: *a i j k l m n p s t u w*. All the vowels are short, and *j* is like English *y*.

### Adjectives

Adjectives come after nouns. So if you wanna say "red bird", you say it like "bird red", or *kiwi lulu*.

Sometimes adjectives are not used literally. For example, *kiwi wan* literally means "bird that is water", but it could also mean "wet bird" or "bird that belongs to water".

### Singular and Plural

Words are not singular nor plural on their own. For example, *kiwi* can mean one bird or multiple birds. The words *un* (one) and *tutu* (group) can be used to explicitly mark singular and plural.

*kiwi un* — a bird

*kiwi tutu* — birds

### To Be

Saja Lili has no verbs. Everything is a noun phrase.

*iti jasa* — good food — The food is good.

### Yes/No Questions

Just use tone or a question mark for yes/no questions.

*iti jasa?* — Is the food good?

The words for "yes" and "no" are *sin* and *nu*.

### Nominalizations

*uju* can be used to nominalize words or phrases like this:

*win* (alive) → *uju win* (life)

*jan jasa* (friend) → *uju ju jan jasa* (friendship)

### Delimiting Phrases

*ju* can be used to control the order in which words are interpreted.

*iti kiwi wan* — liquid bird food

*iti ju kiwi wan* — food of water bird

### And/Or

*ija* means "and" or "or".

*ana ija anta* — me and/or you

You can use *tutu* and *un* to make it more specific:

*tutu ju ana ija anta* — group of me and you — me and you

*un ju ana ija anta* — one of me or you — me or you

### What

"What" in Saja Lili is *kuwa*. Combine it with other words to form other question words like "when".

*anta kuwa?* — Who are you?

*timi kuwa jasa?* — What time is good?

### Context Phrases

*aja* introduces context for the next phrase. The context can be a topic, subject, condition or whatever.

*iti aja ani jasa?* — Speaking of food, is this good?

*kiwi aja ana wan!* — The bird made me wet!

*iti jasa aja anta jasa.* — If the food is good, you're good.

### Requests and Commands

You can use *wili* (will/wanted) with *anta* for requests and commands.

*wili ju anta siwi!* — It's wanted that you're seen! — Be seen!

Or if the context is clear (for example, when the thing you want didn't happen yet), just say what you want:

*anta siwi!* — Be seen!

### Prepositions

*kiwi in wan.* — The bird is in the water.

*kiwi pija wan.* — The bird is going toward the water.

*kiwi kama wan.* — The bird is coming out of the water.

*kiwi kumu ana.* — The bird is with me.

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them.

*kiwi in ju lipi.* — The bird inside is asleep.

### Sound Rules

Saja Lili has very limited rules on how words can be spoken. All syllables can optionally start with a consonant, have a vowel in the middle, and optionally end in *n*.

Vowels next to each other, *nn* and *nm* in a single word are not allowed. So are *ji* and *wu*.

### Interjections

Interjections are allowed to break the sound rules. Feel free to make up your own!

*kiki!* — haha!

*uu!* — oo!

*muwa!* — mwah!

You can use interjections as nouns and adjectives.

### Lilizations

A lilization is a foreign word spoken with the limited sound rules.

*Apika* — Africa

*Kun* — Ghoom

It's not required to capitalize lilizations. But it might be necessary if the lilization looks exactly like a native Saja Lili word.

It's best to lilize words from their original language if possible.

### Numbers

There are only six digits in Saja Lili.

nu — 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; un — 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tuwi — 2

taja — 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kata — 4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun — 5

This system is called senary or seximal.

Let's dissect the following number to understand more:

*kata sun sun un sun tuwi* — 412 (in senary) — 107 (in decimal)

Multiple *sun*'s next to each other are multiplied alongside the digit that comes immediately before *sun*.

*kata sun sun* — 4×5×5

*un sun* — 1×5

The final products are then added with the last digit.

*kata sun sun un sun tuwi* — 4×5×5 + 1×5 + 2

# Saj Lil

Saj Lil is a minimalist constructed language with very few sounds and words, inspired by Toki Pona. It's goal is to be more usable, and have a more efficient vocabulary and grammar than Toki Pona.

> **Warning** The language is not set in stone. Official words may be added or removed, and their hand gestures may be changed at any time! Your feedback will be much appreciated! You can contact me on Discord (ghoom#1775) or Reddit ([u/Unlimiter](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlimiter)).

# Phonology and Orthography

**Consonants:** p t k m n s l

**Vowels:** a i u

*i* and *u* can alternatively be written as *j* and *w* respectively for better readability.

More sound rules are explained [later](#sound-rules).

# Other Ways to Communicate

There's [Saj Min](#saj-min) (a hand-signed system) and [Kim Liki](#kim-liki) (a cute writing system).

# Grammar

## Adjectives

Adjectives in Saj Lil come after the word or phrase they modify, which can be modified in different ways depending on context.

Nouns and adjectives are always interchangeable.

## Singular and Plural

Singular and plural nouns are not grammatically marked. For example, *kiw* can either mean one or more birds, depending on context. Use *un* (*one*) for singular, and *tutu* (*group*) for plural.

## Describing States and Actions

Saj Lil has no verbs.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>lala lipi.
	<dd>They are asleep. (<i>lit.</i> them asleep)
	<dt>ana aj pukuku mul!
	<dd>I slayed the monster! (<i>lit.</i> me that monster dead)
</dl>
<br>

*aj* is a relative "clause" conjunction.

## Imperative

Imperative sentences (requests and commands) don't have special grammar.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>siw!
	<dd>Show yourself! (<i>lit.</i> seen)
	<dt>aj ana wata!
	<dd>Fight me! (<i>lit.</i> that me fought)
</dl>
<br>

Make an imperative a [yes/no question](#yesno-questions) to make it explicitly polite.

## Conjunctions

<dl>
	<dt>ija<dd>and
</dl>
<br>

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>jan ana ju mam sam ju maka i wiw.
	<dd>My sibling is big and crazy. (<i>lit.</i> mutually-known-person mine of parent same of big and crazy)
	<dt>in taj pus, aa mus ana ija lala pipi.
	<dd>Yesterday, I sang and they danced. (<i>lit.</i> in day past, uttered fun mine and them moving)
	<dt>wil anta in un ju sasa ija sasa?
	<dd>You want this or that? (<i>lit.</i> wanted yours in one of near and far)
</dl>

## Yes/No Questions

Yes/no questions don't have special grammar. Just use tone or a question mark.

**Example:**

<dl>
	<dt>kun anta iti?
	<dd>You have food? (<i>lit.</i> possession yours food)
</dl>

## Fact Questions

*kwa* (*what*) is the only question pronoun.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>ana kwa? anta kwa?
	<dd>What am I? What are you? (<i>lit.</i> me what? you what?)
	<dt>mun in sun in tim kwa?
	<dd>When is the eclipse? (<i>lit.</i> moon on star in time what)
	<dt>man kwa aj wan japa ana iti?!
	<dd>Who drank my juice?! (<i>lit.</i> human what that liquid fruit mine consumed)
	<dt>miw anta kam kwa?
	<dd>Why do you think so? (<i>lit.</i> thought yours from what)
	<dt>anta in sja ju nan kwa?
	<dd>How are you flying? (<i>lit.</i> you in sky of manner what)
	<dt>pja (tal) kwa?
	<dd>To where? (<i>lit.</i> to (place) what)
</dl>

## Preposition Flexibility

Prepositions don't require nouns before or after them. They can simply be infered. All the following sentences using *in* are correct:

<dl>
	<dt>ata in ju nu kan.
	<dd>The contents are unknown. (<i>lit.</i> things in of not known)
	<dt>in!
	<dd>Get in! (<i>lit.</i> in)
</dl>

## Tense and Aspect

There is no grammatical way to indicate tense or aspect.

**Examples:**

<dl>
	<dt>wil ana ju swa wis kum wan.
	<dd>I'm going to shower (<i>lit.</i> wanted mine of self clean with liquid)
	<dt>lala mul in taj pus.
	<dd>It died yesterday. (<i>lit.</i> it dead in day past)
	<dt>awa tipi pja anta in al tutu taj.
	<dd>You always forget that. (<i>lit.</i> far forgotten for you in whole group day)
	<dt>Mali asta kam tim tum.
	<dd>Marry has been waiting all night. (<i>lit.</i> Marry waiting from time dark)
</dl>

Of course, if the context is clear, indicating tense or aspect is not necessary.

# Lilization

Lilization is when you make a foreign name fit within Saj Lil's limited sounds.

## Sound Rules

- Syllables can optionally start with any consonant, have any number of vowels in the middle, and optionally end in *m*, *n*, *s* or *l*.
- *np* and *mt* are disallowed inside a single word.
- The *n* in *nk* can sound like the *ng* in *thing*.

## Methods

A good rule of thumb is to go by instinct and determine what sounds the closest to the original name to you.

Lilizing names from their native languages is the most language-neutral way to do so. But since it can be tiring to memorize lots of lilizations from their native languages, my best advice is to know the most common language between you and your chat partners and lilize the name from that.

For example, if the common language is English and the country you want to talk about is Norway, just lilize that English word to get *Nulwaj*.

Lastly, if you have no idea how to lilize something, just say or write it as is in a language you know. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

> **Note** It's not required to capitalize lilizations, but sometimes it might be necessary to capitalize names that look like native Saj Lil words.

# Phrases

These are some random phrases I thought of:

<dl>
	<dt>(anta) jas
	<dd>thank you (<i>lit.</i> (you) liked)
	<dt>nu piliki
	<dd>you're welcome (<i>lit.</i> not difficult)
	<dt>nu wil ana
	<dd>sorry (<i>lit.</i> not wanted mine)
	<dt>wil
	<dd>please (<i>lit.</i> wanted)
	<dt>naj jas
	<dd>welcome (<i>lit.</i> near liked)
	<dt>awa jam!
	<dd>goodbye! (<i>lit.</i> far okay)
	<dt>anti aj ...
	<dd>but ... (<i>lit.</i> contrasting that ...)
	<dt>kam aj ...
	<dd>because ... (<i>lit.</i> from that ...)
	<dt>jan mam
	<dd>family relative (<i>lit.</i> mutually-known-person parent)
</dl>

# Saj Min

Saj Min is a hand-signed system for Saj Lil that features easy and recognizable gestures for each sound.

- *a* is signed with a stretched palm
- *i* is signed with a semi-open hand
- *u* is signed with a fist
- *p* is signed with a hand with an all fingers open except the thumb
- *t* is signed with a hand with an open index, middle finger and ring finger
- *k* is signed with a fist with an open index and middle finger
- *m* is signed with a fist with an open index
- *n* is signed with a fist with an open thumb
- *s* is signed with an OK hand
- *l* is signed with a fist with an open thumb and index

If you want to be more efficient (and have two hands), you can use both hands to sign two sounds at the same time. The right hand should sign the preceding sound.

# Kim Liki

Kim Liki is an artistic left-to-right writing system for Saj Lil, partly inspired by [robdog's writing system for his conlang Aaltok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBKsVwo62mM). Glyphs are drawn as little shapes with faces, called *lillies*. Lillies are arranged into groups that can be structured in one of these ways:

- vowel
- vowel–consonant
- vowel–vowel
- vowel–vowel–consonant
- vowel–vowel–vowel
- consonant
- consonant–vowel
- consonant–vowel–vowel
- consonant–vowel–consonant

The first lillie in a word has legs.

The initial sound of the group determines the shape of the main lillie:

- *a* — dotted square
- *i* — dotted triangle
- *u* — dotted circle
- *p* — hill
- *t* — square
- *k* — triangle
- *m* — circle
- *n* — cloud
- *s* — bowl
- *l* — drop

The second sound determines the shape of the main lillie's mouth:

- *a* — grin
- *i* — smile
- *u* — circle

If the group is only a vowel or consonant, the lillie should have no mouth.

The way a group is expressed, determines the shape of the eyes of all lillies in the group:

- normal — dot eyes
- high tone (for emphasis or yes/no questions) — happy closed eyes

If a lillie is part of a lilized word, it should have eyeglasses.

If the group ends in a consonant, that consonant is represented by a smaller lillie next to the main one.

If the group has three sounds and ends in a vowel, that vowel is represented with a text-bubble-shaped lillie next the main lillie, with the vowel determining its mouth shape.

> **Note** Small lillies and text bubbles are not required to have eyeglasses if they're part of a lilization.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come after an opening quote, or if it's the only word in a quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the right. And if the word is supposed to come before a closing quote, the lillie's face should be closer to the left.

If the word that a lillie belongs to is supposed to come before a comma, the lillie should have a lowered arm to the right of the viewer.

The first lillie in a sentence should have a raised arm to the left of the viewer, and the last one should have a raised arm to the right of the viewer.

The last lillie in an interrogative or exclamative sentence should have wiggle lines next to its hand.

**Example:**

*man lil Piita ija lus lala aj si "taj jas"?*
